## Heimatbrot / Homebread
### First of all, Welcome to my GitHub profile!ðŸ’»

#### Why Heimatbrot?
Well actually I was looking for a new name for a game. But all my ideas I had were already gone. So I started trying more random stuff, yeah Heimatbrot worked fine.
Since then this is my alias for almost everything I do online.

#### What am I doing on GitHub?
I'm just trying out stuff and upload it to GitHub so I can access it from multiple devices and release static things on GitHub Pages.

#### How can we contact you?
You can write a mail to my gaming adress: [heimatbrot@outlook.com]

#### FYI
Don't take my code on this repo to serios. I'm just the type of "learning by doing" so it doesn't look good or is beautiful code here. But it helps me to learn more and thats my goal.
